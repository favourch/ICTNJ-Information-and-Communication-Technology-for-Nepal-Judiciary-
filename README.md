The ICTNJ Project consist of various systems: - Case Management System (CMS), Personnel Management System (PMS), Lawyer and Judge Management System (LJMS) and Office Automation System (OAS). Among these modules I was mostly involved in Case Management System. This application holds the information about weekly and daily cause lists and cases the benches is now available in the Supreme Court of Nepal and gets information about the latest status of the progress of a case at seven to eight benches of the court in session daily to hear and decide the case on a particular date. The bench officer in the room updates status of a case once the hearing progresses in the bench.
